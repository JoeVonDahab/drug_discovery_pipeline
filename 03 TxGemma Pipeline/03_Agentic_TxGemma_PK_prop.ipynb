I would plan to predict key ADME parameters (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) using computational models, focusing on oral bioavailability, blood-brain barrier penetration, metabolic stability (CYP inhibition/induction), and potential efflux pump interactions.

To provide a comprehensive answer, I would proceed by outlining the various PK parameters that are typically assessed, considering the implications of the already known low bioavailability, and how I would (if able to use tools) predict them.\n",
      "\n",
      "**PK Properties to Consider:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Absorption (A):**\n",
      "    *   **Oral Bioavailability (F):** Already predicted as < 20%. This is a critical factor, indicating poor oral absorption or extensive first-pass metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Permeability:** Intestinal permeability (e.g., Caco-2 permeability) is important. Low permeability could contribute to poor absorption.\n",
      "    *   **Solubility:** Aqueous solubility, especially at physiological pH, is crucial for dissolution and absorption. Poor solubility can limit bioavailability.\n",
      "    *   **Efflux Transporter Interactions:** Is the drug a substrate for efflux pumps like P-gp? This could significantly reduce absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Distribution (D):**\n",
      "    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** Indicates how widely a drug distributes throughout the body. High lipophilicity often leads to high Vd.\n",
      "    *   **Plasma Protein Binding (PPB):** The fraction of drug bound to plasma proteins affects the free drug concentration, which is the pharmacologically active form. High PPB can limit distribution to tissues.\n",
      "    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeation:** Important for CNS-targeted drugs or to assess potential CNS side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Metabolism (M):**\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic Stability:** How quickly the drug is metabolized, primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, but also by other enzymes (e.g., esterases, glucuronidation). This impacts half-life and clearance.\n",
      "    *   **CYP Inhibition/Induction:** Does the drug inhibit or induce major CYP isoforms (e.g., CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 1A2)? This is critical for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs).\n",
      "    *   **Metabolite Formation:** Identification of major metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Excretion (E):**\n",
      "    *   **Clearance (CL):** The rate at which the drug is removed from the body, typically hepatic and/or renal.\n",
      "    *   **Renal Excretion:** Is the drug excreted unchanged via the kidneys?\n",
      "    *   **Biliary Excretion:** Is the drug excreted via bile?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Inferences from the Low Bioavailability (< 20%):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the predicted low oral bioavailability, the following are likely contributing factors:\n",
      "*   **Poor Aqueous Solubility:** The molecule appears fairly large and could be hydrophobic, potentially limiting its dissolution in the GI tract.\n",
      "*   **Low Intestinal Permeability:** The molecule might not readily cross the intestinal membrane.\n",
      "*   **Significant First-Pass Metabolism:** The drug might be extensively metabolized in the liver before reaching systemic circulation.\n",
      "*   **Efflux Pump Substrate:** The drug could be pumped out of enterocytes back into the gut lumen by efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Summary of PK Properties of COc1c(F)cccc1C1=C(c2ccc(O[C@H]3CCN(CCCF)C3)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc2CCC1:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most significant PK property known so far is its **poor predicted oral bioavailability (< 20%)**. This suggests challenges with absorption (e.g., low solubility, low permeability, efflux) and/or extensive first-pass metabolism. Further analysis of its physiochemical properties (LogP, TPSA, molecular weight), metabolic fate, and transporter interactions would be necessary to fully characterize its PK profile.\n",

      "I am unable to use tools currently.\n",
      "The user wants to know the PK properties of the given drug. I have already established that its oral bioavailability is predicted to be < 20%. To provide a complete PK profile, I would address the core ADME parameters (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), identifying potential contributing factors to the observed low bioavailability and outlining other key PK characteristics that would need to be assessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Predicted PK Properties:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Absorption (A):**\n",
      "    *   **Oral Bioavailability:** **Predicted to be < 20%**. This is a major concern, indicating poor absorption or extensive first-pass metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Potential contributing factors:** Based on the structure, the molecule is relatively large (MW ~ 500-600 g/mol, which is borderline for oral drugs) and appears to have several rotatable bonds, suggesting potential for low permeability and/or solubility issues, or it might be a substrate for efflux pumps (like P-glycoprotein) in the gut. The presence of a tertiary amine (in the piperidine ring) could make it ionizable, affecting solubility and permeability depending on pH.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Distribution (D):**\n",
      "    *   **Lipophilicity (LogP/D):** The molecule appears moderately to highly lipophilic due to the extensive aromatic and aliphatic systems. High lipophilicity often correlates with high volume of distribution (Vd) and plasma protein binding.\n",
      "    *   **Plasma Protein Binding (PPB):** Given its apparent lipophilicity and size, it is likely to exhibit high plasma protein binding, which means a smaller fraction of the drug would be free (pharmacologically active).\n",
      "    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeation:** Without specific prediction, it's hard to say definitively. The fluorine atom and the relatively high lipophilicity might suggest some permeability, but the piperidine ring could also lead to efflux by transporters at the BBB.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Metabolism (M):**\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic Stability:** The presence of several aromatic rings, an ether linkage, and an aliphatic chain with a tertiary amine suggests multiple potential sites for metabolism (e.g., oxidative metabolism by CYP450 enzymes). The trifluoromethyl group (-CCCF) is generally metabolically stable, but the adjacent amine could be a target. Extensive first-pass metabolism is a strong possibility given the low bioavailability.\n",
      "    *   **CYP Inhibition/Induction:** The molecule's structure could potentially lead to interactions with CYP enzymes, either as inhibitors or inducers. This would require specific prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Excretion (E):**\n",
      "    *   **Clearance:** Likely to be primarily hepatic clearance due to metabolism, possibly with some renal excretion of metabolites or the parent compound if it's sufficiently polar.\n",
      "    *   **Excretion Pathway:** Due to its size and lipophilicity, biliary excretion of the parent drug or its metabolites is also a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Key PK Properties:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent PK property identified is the **very low predicted oral bioavailability (< 20%)**, which significantly impacts its utility as an orally administered drug. This suggests that the drug would require a high dose or an alternative administration route to achieve therapeutic concentrations. Other properties like high plasma protein binding, significant metabolic clearance, and potential efflux pump interactions are also likely, contributing to its overall PK profile.

      "\n",
      "*   **Oral Bioavailability:** Predicted to be **< 20%**. This is a significant finding, indicating that the drug likely has poor oral absorption or undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. This low bioavailability suggests that achieving therapeutic plasma concentrations via oral administration might be challenging and could require very high doses, or an alternative route of administration might be necessary.\n",
      "*   **Half-Life (Obach model):** Predicted to be **10.00 hours**. A half-life of 10 hours suggests a moderate duration of action, which could allow for once or twice daily dosing in a clinical setting, provided sufficient systemic exposure can be achieved.\n",
      "*   **Steady-State Volume of Distribution (VDss Lombardo model):** Predicted to be **3.00 L/kg**. This value indicates that the drug distributes moderately well from the bloodstream into body tissues and fluids.

      "*   **Plasma Protein Binding:** The extent to which the drug binds to plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein). High protein binding can limit the concentration of free (pharmacologically active) drug available to exert its effect.\n",
      "*   **Metabolism:** Identification of specific metabolic pathways and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved (e.g., CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C9). This is crucial for understanding metabolic stability, clearance, and potential drug-drug interactions (inhibition or induction of other drug-metabolizing enzymes).\n",
      "*   **Excretion:** The primary routes by which the drug and its metabolites are eliminated from the body (e.g., renal excretion via urine, biliary excretion via feces).\n",
      "*   **Clearance:** The overall rate at which the drug is removed from the systemic circulation, integrating metabolism and excretion.\n",
