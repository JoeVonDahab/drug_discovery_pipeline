SMILES: C1COCCN1NC2=C(C=C(C=C2)C(F)(F)F)[N+](=O)[O-]
Response: Yes, the drug with the SMILES string C1COCCN1NC2=C(C=C(C=C2)C(F)(F)F)[N+](=O)[O-] is predicted to be toxic.

The primary properties that make this drug toxic are the presence of the **nitro group (-NO2)** and the **hydrazine linkage (-N-N-)**.

**Reasons for Toxicity:**

*   **Nitro groups (-NO2):** Aromatic nitro groups are readily reduced *in vivo* by enzymes (e.g., nitroreductases) to highly reactive intermediates such as nitroso (-NO) and hydroxylamine (-NHOH) derivatives. These intermediates are known to:
    *   Covalently bind to macromolecules like DNA and proteins, leading to genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity.
    *   Cause oxidative stress.
    *   Induce methemoglobinemia by oxidizing hemoglobin.
    *   Further reduction can lead to aromatic amines, some of which are also carcinogenic after metabolic activation.
*   **Hydrazine linkages (-N-N-):** Hydrazine derivatives can undergo various metabolic transformations that lead to reactive species. They are known to:
    *   Be metabolically activated to form reactive radicals that cause oxidative damage.
    *   Form electrophilic species that can alkylate or acylate DNA and proteins, leading to genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity.
    *   Cause hepatotoxicity (liver damage).
    *   Interfere with neurotransmitter systems, leading to neurotoxicity.

**Suggested Functional Group Replacements to Mitigate Toxicity:**

To reduce toxicity while potentially retaining desired pharmacological activity, consider the following replacements for the identified toxic sections:

*   **For the Nitro group (-NO2):**
    *   **Cyano group (-CN):** A common bioisostere that provides electron-withdrawing properties without the reductive metabolism issues.
    *   **Sulfonyl group (-SO2R) or Sulfonamide (-SO2NH2):** Can offer similar electronic effects and hydrogen bonding capabilities.
    *   **Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3):** A strongly electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable group, often used to replace nitro groups.
    *   **Small Heterocyclic Rings:** Nitrogen-containing heterocycles like oxadiazoles, triazoles, or pyrazoles can sometimes mimic the electronic and steric properties of a nitro group, potentially with reduced toxicity.

*   **For the Hydrazine linkage (-N-N-):**
    *   **Amine linkage (-CH2-NH- or -NH-CH2-):** Replacing one of the nitrogen atoms with a carbon to break the reactive N-N bond, forming a more stable aminomethylene bridge.
    *   **Carbon-Carbon Linkage (-CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH-, or -C≡C-):** Directly linking the two parts with a stable carbon chain or unsaturated bond to remove the reactive hydrazine moiety entirely.
    *   **Ether linkage (-O-) or Thioether linkage (-S-):** If the primary role is a simple linker, oxygen or sulfur can be used, although they change the electronic and hydrogen-bonding properties significantly.
    *   **Amide Linkage (-CONH-):** Introducing a carbonyl group can stabilize the nitrogen, but potential hydrolysis needs to be considered.
    *   **Cyclization:** Incorporating the hydrazine into a stable heterocyclic ring (e.g., a triazole or pyrazole) can stabilize the N-N bond, provided the new ring does not introduce new toxicophores.

Any structural modification requires careful consideration of the compound's intended therapeutic target, mechanism of action, and how the changes might affect its physiochemical properties (e.g., lipophilicity, pKa), metabolic stability, and binding affinity. A thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) study would be essential to identify optimal non-toxic replacements that maintain or improve desired pharmacological activity.

SMILES: O=[N+]([O-])c1c(NCc2ccccc2)ccc2nonc12
Response: Yes, the drug `O=[N+]([O-])c1c(NCc2ccccc2)ccc2nonc12` is predicted to be toxic.

The primary property that makes this drug toxic is the presence of the **nitro group (`-NO2`)** directly attached to the aromatic ring. Scientific literature (e.g., "Nitro-Group-Containing Drugs," PMID: 30295477) identifies the nitro group as a "structural alert or a toxicophore" that is "extensively associated with mutagenicity and genotoxicity." This toxicity often arises from the bioreductive activation of the nitro group by enzymes in the body. This process can lead to the formation of highly reactive intermediates (such as nitroso and hydroxylamine derivatives, or even reactive oxygen species) that can damage DNA, proteins, and other cellular components, contributing to the observed toxicity.

To reduce the toxicity associated with the nitro group, you could consider replacing it with functional groups that are generally less reactive and have a better safety profile, while potentially retaining some of the electronic or steric properties if they are crucial for the drug's intended activity. Here are some suggestions:

1.  **Amide (`-CONH2` or `-CONHR`):** These are generally polar, metabolically stable, and non-toxic, and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
2.  **Sulfone (`-SO2R`):** This is another polar, electron-withdrawing group that can serve as a bioisostere for a nitro group in some contexts, potentially offering similar electronic effects without the same genotoxic risk.
3.  **Cyano (`-C≡N`):** This is a small, polar, and electron-withdrawing group that can sometimes be used as a bioisostere for nitro groups.
4.  **Halogen (e.g., `-F`, `-Cl`):** Fluorine or chlorine atoms are less reactive and can modify electronic properties and lipophilicity, which might be beneficial for drug-receptor interactions.
5.  **Small alkyl groups (e.g., `-CH3`, `-CF3`):** If the electron-withdrawing or polar nature of the nitro group is not critical for activity, a simple alkyl or trifluoromethyl group could reduce toxicity while potentially influencing lipophilicity and steric interactions.
6.  **Hydrogen (`-H`):** Removing the group entirely (replacing it with hydrogen) is the simplest approach if the nitro group's presence is not essential for pharmacological activity.

The choice of replacement should be guided by further medicinal chemistry studies to assess the impact on the drug's desired pharmacological activity, physicochemical properties, and overall safety profile.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(CNc2ccc3nonc3c2[N+](=O)[O-])cc1
Response: Yes, the drug with the SMILES string `Cc1ccc(CNc2ccc3nonc3c2[N+](=O)[O-])cc1` is predicted to be toxic.

The primary property that makes this drug toxic is the presence of the **aromatic nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-])**. Aromatic nitro compounds are often associated with toxicity due to their metabolic activation within the body. Common mechanisms of toxicity associated with aromatic nitro groups include:

1.  **Metabolic Activation:** These groups can be reduced by various enzymes (e.g., nitroreductases) to highly reactive intermediates such as nitro radicals, nitroso derivatives, and hydroxylamines.
2.  **DNA Damage:** These reactive metabolites can act as electrophiles, alkylating DNA and forming adducts, leading to mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and carcinogenicity.
3.  **Oxidative Stress:** The redox cycling of nitro compounds can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative damage to cellular components.
4.  **Methemoglobinemia:** Some nitro compounds can oxidize the ferrous iron (Fe2+) in hemoglobin to ferric iron (Fe3+), forming methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen efficiently, leading to tissue hypoxia.

To mitigate this toxicity, the aromatic nitro group can be replaced with less reactive or bioisosteric functional groups. Here are some suggestions for functional groups that can replace the toxic nitro section:

*   **Cyano (-CN):** A less reactive electron-withdrawing group that can mimic some electronic properties of the nitro group without the same metabolic activation pathway.
*   **Methyl sulfone (-SO2CH3):** Another electron-withdrawing group that is generally more metabolically stable and less prone to reductive activation.
*   **Amide (-CONH2):** A polar, non-reducible functional group that can provide similar hydrogen bonding interactions.
*   **Sulfonamide (-SO2NH2):** Similar to amides, sulfonamides are often metabolically stable and do not typically undergo the same reductive activation as nitro groups.
*   **Trifluoromethyl (-CF3):** A strong electron-withdrawing group that is metabolically stable.
*   **Other nitrogen-containing groups:** In some cases, depending on the desired electronic and steric properties, groups like triazoles or tetrazoles might be considered as replacements if a nitrogen atom is required, but careful consideration of their metabolic stability is also needed.

The choice of replacement group would depend on maintaining the desired pharmacological activity while eliminating or significantly reducing the toxic liabilities.

SMILES: [3H]c1ccc2nonc2c1[N+](=O)[O-]
Response: Yes, the drug with SMILES `[3H]c1ccc2nonc2c1[N+](=O)[O-]` is predicted to be toxic.

Here are the properties that contribute to its toxicity:

1.  **Radioactivity (Tritium - [3H]):** The presence of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is a significant source of toxicity. Tritium emits low-energy beta particles. If incorporated into biological molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, or water, these emissions can cause cellular damage, including DNA strand breaks and mutations, potentially leading to carcinogenesis due to internal exposure.

2.  **Nitroaromatic Moiety (`-NO2` on an aromatic ring):** Aromatic nitro compounds are well-known for their toxicity.
    *   **Reductive Metabolism:** In the body, the nitro group (`-NO2`) can be metabolically reduced by various enzymes (e.g., nitroreductases) to highly reactive intermediates like nitroso (`-N=O`) and hydroxylamine (`-NHOH`).
    *   **Electrophilic Intermediates:** These derivatives are potent electrophiles and can react covalently with nucleophilic sites on critical biological macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins, forming adducts.
    *   **Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity:** The formation of DNA adducts can lead to DNA damage, mutations, and chromosomal aberrations, resulting in genotoxicity and a high potential for carcinogenicity.
    *   **Oxidative Stress:** The redox cycling of nitro groups can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
    *   **Hematological Toxicity:** Some nitroaromatic compounds can induce methemoglobinemia (reducing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity) and hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells).

3.  **Benzofurazan Scaffold:** While the 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (benzofurazan) scaffold itself isn't universally toxic, its combination with a highly reactive nitro group can synergistically enhance certain toxic pathways or contribute to the molecule's overall reactivity and biological activity.

**Suggested Functional Group Replacements to Reduce Toxicity:**

To mitigate the toxicity, the primary goal is to remove the radioactive isotope and replace the reactive nitro group with more stable and less toxic functional groups.

1.  **For the Tritium ([3H]):**
    *   **Replace with non-radioactive hydrogen ([1H]):** This is the most straightforward and effective way to eliminate the radioactive toxicity, assuming the tritium is not integral to the intended therapeutic mechanism (e.g., for radiopharmaceuticals).
    *   **Replace with Deuterium ([2H]):** If there's a need to maintain a specific metabolic stability profile related to the C-H bond, deuterium substitution can sometimes be used, as it is non-radioactive.

2.  **For the Nitro Group (`-NO2`):** The aim is to replace it with a metabolically stable group that is less prone to reduction and the formation of electrophilic intermediates, while ideally retaining or modulating the desired therapeutic activity.
    *   **Common Replacements to Reduce Toxicity:**
        *   **Amide (`-CONH2`, `-CONHR`):** Generally stable and less prone to reduction.
        *   **Sulfonamide (`-SO2NH2`, `-SO2NHR`):** Often metabolically stable, commonly used in medicinal chemistry.
        *   **Cyano (`-CN`):** Electron-withdrawing, but generally less reductively toxic than nitro.
        *   **Fluorine (`-F`):** A single fluorine atom is a common bioisostere that can modulate electronic properties and metabolic stability without the toxicity of a nitro group.
        *   **Alkyl groups (`-CH3`, `-C2H5`):** Increase lipophilicity and are generally metabolically stable.
        *   **Methoxy (`-OCH3`):** An electron-donating group, generally stable against reduction.
        *   **Carboxylic Acid (`-COOH`) or its ester (`-COOR`):** Can introduce ionizable properties; esters are typically cleavable *in vivo*.
        *   **Halogens (e.g., `-Cl`, `-Br`):** Can be used to modify lipophilicity and electronic properties.
    *   **Groups to consider with caution:** While less problematic than nitro, aromatic **amino groups (`-NH2`)** can also be metabolically activated to genotoxic species (e.g., via N-hydroxylation). Therefore, if an amino group is considered, its metabolic fate should be carefully evaluated.

The best replacement will depend on the specific role of the nitro group in the compound's original biological activity and the desired pharmacokinetic properties.

SMILES: O=[N+]([O-])c1c(NCc2cc(F)cc(Cl)c2)ccc2nonc12
Response: Based on the analyses, the drug `O=[N+]([O-])c1c(NCc2cc(F)cc(Cl)c2)ccc2nonc12` is predicted to be **toxic** by Clinical Toxicology Prediction. However, it is specifically predicted to be **not mutagenic** by AMES Mutagenicity Prediction.

While the general toxicity prediction does not specify the exact toxic properties, the presence of the **nitro group (O=[N+]([O-])** and the **halogenated aromatic ring** (containing fluorine and chlorine) are structural features commonly associated with toxicity in drug molecules.

**Properties that may contribute to toxicity:**
*   **Nitro Group:** Despite not being mutagenic in this specific case, nitro groups are often metabolically reduced to reactive intermediates, such as nitroso and hydroxylamine species, which can lead to various toxicities. Common concerns include methemoglobinemia, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), cardiotoxicity (heart damage), and oxidative stress.
*   **Halogenated Aromatic Ring (F, Cl):** Polyhalogenated aromatic rings, particularly with multiple halogens, can sometimes contribute to metabolic instability, leading to the formation of reactive electrophilic metabolites that can covalently bind to proteins and DNA, causing cellular damage. This can manifest as hepatotoxicity or neurotoxicity.

**Suggested Functional Group Replacements:**

To potentially reduce the toxicity associated with these sections, considering bioisosteric replacements that maintain desirable pharmacological properties while mitigating toxic liabilities:

1.  **For the Nitro Group (O=[N+]([O-])):**
    *   **Amide (-CONHR):** Can maintain electron-withdrawing properties or hydrogen bonding capabilities.
    *   **Nitrile (-CN):** A metabolically stable electron-withdrawing group.
    *   **Sulfonyl (-SO2R):** Another electron-withdrawing group that can be bioisosteric.
    *   **Non-reducible nitrogen heterocycles:** Such as imidazole, pyrazole, or oxadiazole rings, which can mimic the electronic properties without the reductive metabolism pathway.
    *   **Carbonyl-containing groups:** Like esters or ketones, if the electronic and steric requirements allow.

2.  **For the Halogenated Aromatic Ring (with F and Cl):**
    *   **Hydrogen (-H):** Simplest replacement, but may alter lipophilicity and binding.
    *   **Methyl (-CH3) or other small alkyl groups:** Can maintain some lipophilicity and steric bulk.
    *   **Alkoxy groups (-OR):** Such as methoxy or ethoxy, can alter electronic properties and lipophilicity.
    *   **Bioisosteric non-halogenated rings:** Replacing the halogenated phenyl with a pyridine, pyrimidine, or a different substituted phenyl ring that avoids the problematic halogenation pattern.
    *   **Alteration of Substitution Pattern:** Even if halogens are retained, changing their positions on the ring can significantly impact metabolic stability and toxicity.
