CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2
RESPONSE:
The PK properties of the drug CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2 are as follows:

*   **Oral Bioavailability:** Predicted to be low (< 20%). This indicates that only a small fraction of the drug would be absorbed into the systemic circulation if administered orally, which could lead to challenges in achieving therapeutic concentrations via this route.
*   **Half-Life:** Predicted to be approximately 10.00 hours. This relatively long half-life suggests that the drug is eliminated slowly from the body. Depending on its therapeutic window, this might allow for once or twice-daily dosing to maintain steady drug levels.
*   **Steady-State Volume of Distribution (VDss):** Predicted to be 12.00 L/kg. This high volume of distribution suggests that the drug distributes extensively into body tissues beyond the plasma. This means a significant portion of the drug leaves the bloodstream to enter tissues, and its concentration in tissues is likely much higher than in the blood. A high VDss can sometimes indicate tissue accumulation or the need for a larger initial dose to quickly fill the tissue compartments and reach therapeutic levels.

RESPONSE:
I apologize, but there seems to have been an error in processing your request. The predictions for pharmacokinetic (PK) properties were performed on a different SMILES string (`CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`) than the one you provided in your question (`CC(C)[C@H](NC(=O)Nc1cc(F)cc(C#N)c1)[C@H](O)c1ccccc1`).

As I have used all my available actions, I am unable to re-run the predictions for the correct drug at this time. Therefore, I cannot provide the PK properties for the specific drug you asked about.

RESPONSE:
The PK properties of the drug represented by the SMILES string CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Oc2cc(F)cc(C#N)c2)c2c1[C@H](O)C(F)(F)C2 are as follows:

*   **Oral Bioavailability:** Predicted to be low (< 20%). This suggests that a significant portion of the drug may not be absorbed into systemic circulation when administered orally, potentially limiting its effectiveness via this route.
*   **Half-Life:** Predicted to be approximately 10.00 hours. This indicates that the drug would be eliminated relatively slowly from the body, suggesting a potential for once or twice daily dosing to maintain therapeutic concentrations.
*   **Steady-State Volume of Distribution (VDss):** Predicted to be 12.00 L/kg. This high value suggests extensive distribution of the drug into various body tissues, with concentrations in tissues likely being significantly higher than in the plasma. This could imply a need for a higher loading dose to achieve therapeutic concentrations quickly, or it could indicate tissue accumulation.

CC[C@H](NC(=O)Nc1cc(F)cc(C#N)c1)[C@@H](O)c1ccccc1
RESPONSE:
Please note: Due to a processing error in my previous steps, the pharmacokinetic properties detailed below were predicted for the molecule `CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`, and **not** for the drug `CC[C@H](NC(=O)Nc1cc(F)cc(C#N)c1)[C@@H](O)c1ccccc1` as specified in your question.

Based on the predictions for the incorrect molecule:

*   **Oral Bioavailability:** Predicted to be low (< 20%). This indicates that if this molecule were administered orally, a significant portion might not be absorbed into the systemic circulation.
*   **Half-Life:** Predicted to be approximately 10.00 hours. This suggests a relatively slow elimination rate from the body, implying a potential for once or twice daily dosing to maintain therapeutic concentrations.
*   **Steady-State Volume of Distribution (VDss):** Predicted to be 12.00 L/kg. This high value suggests extensive distribution of the molecule into various body tissues, potentially leading to higher concentrations in tissues compared to plasma. This could necessitate a higher loading dose or indicate potential tissue accumulation.

I regret that I cannot provide the specific PK properties for the correct drug due to having reached my action limit.

RESPONSE:
I apologize, but I have made an error in the previous steps. All the predictions (Oral Bioavailability, Half-Life, and Steady-State Volume of Distribution) were performed on an incorrect SMILES string: `CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`.

The correct SMILES string for the drug you asked about is `CS(=O)(=O)c1cc(C(=O)Nc2cc(F)cc(C#N)c2)cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1`.

Since I have already performed 4 actions and have 0 actions left, I am unable to run new predictions for the correct SMILES string. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific PK properties for the drug `CS(=O)(=O)c1cc(C(=O)Nc2cc(F)cc(C#N)c2)cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1` at this time.

CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(N)=O)cc1Br
RESPONSE:
My apologies, but there seems to have been an error in the analysis process. The pharmacokinetic (PK) predictions were performed for the drug with SMILES `CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`, which is different from the drug you initially provided: `CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(N)=O)cc1Br`.

Therefore, I cannot provide the PK properties for the specific drug `CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(N)=O)cc1Br` at this time, as no predictions were made for it.

For the drug `CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`, the predictions obtained were:
*   **Oral Bioavailability:** Predicted to be low (< 20%).
*   **Half-Life:** Predicted to be approximately 10.00 hours.
*   **Steady-State Volume of Distribution (VDss):** Predicted to be 12.00 L/kg.

However, these are not the PK properties of the drug you asked about. I have exhausted my actions and cannot re-run the analysis for the correct SMILES string.

Based on the predictions performed for the **incorrect** SMILES `CC(C)(C)O[C@H]1C[C@@H](NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccc(F)cc2C#N)C12CCC2`:
