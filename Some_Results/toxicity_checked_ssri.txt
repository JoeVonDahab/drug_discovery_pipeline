SMILES: CN(C)CCCC1(C2=C(CO1)C=C(C=C2)C#N)C3=CC=C(C=C3)F
Response: Yes, the drug **CN(C)CCCC1(C2=C(CO1)C=C(C=C2)C#N)C3=CC=C(C=C3)F** is predicted to be toxic.

The primary functional groups likely contributing to its toxicity are the **nitrile group (C#N)** and the **tertiary amine**.

Here's why these properties can make it toxic:

*   **Nitrile (C#N) Toxicity**: Nitrile groups can be metabolically unstable. In the body, they may be hydrolyzed to release cyanide, which is a potent mitochondrial toxin that disrupts cellular respiration. Additionally, some nitriles can act as electrophiles, reacting via Michael addition with biological nucleophiles (e.g., thiol groups on proteins), leading to adduct formation and potential cellular damage or protein dysfunction.
*   **Tertiary Amine Toxicity**: Tertiary amines are often highly basic and lipophilic. Their basicity can lead to interactions with various biological targets, resulting in undesirable off-target pharmacological effects (e.g., anticholinergic activity, or blockade of ion channels like hERG, which can cause cardiac issues). They can also be involved in metabolic reactions such as N-oxidation, which sometimes produces reactive intermediates that can be toxic, or they can saturate metabolic enzymes, impairing drug clearance and leading to accumulation. Their lipophilicity can also influence drug distribution and accumulation in tissues, potentially leading to increased systemic exposure and toxicity.

To mitigate toxicity, you could consider the following replacements for these functional groups:

1.  **For the nitrile (C#N)**: Consider replacing it with bioisosteric groups such as a **tetrazole**, **oxadiazole**, or a **carboxylic acid/ester**. These replacements can often maintain similar electronic properties (e.g., as hydrogen bond acceptors or lipophilic groups that can mimic the electron-withdrawing nature of a nitrile) while eliminating the potential for cyanide release or direct electrophilic reactivity.
2.  **For the tertiary amine (CN(C)C)**: Modifications could involve reducing its basicity or lipophilicity. This might be achieved by replacing it with a less basic amine (e.g., a **secondary amine**, a **primary amine** with steric hindrance, or a **cyclic amine** like piperidine or morpholine), or a non-amine polar group such as an **alcohol**, **ether**, or **amide**, depending on the critical role of this group in the drug's intended activity and the desired pharmacokinetic profile.
