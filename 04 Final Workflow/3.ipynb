      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aspirin is known for its therapeutic benefits in preventing strokes and relieving pain. However, it is toxic to some individuals, and the biological mechanisms causing toxicity are unknown. Limited literature is available on the role of glycine conjugation as the principal pathway in aspirin detoxification. Previous studies have quantified this two-step enzyme reaction as a singular enzymatic process. Consequently, the individual contributions of these enzymes to the kinetics remain unclear. AREAS COVERED: This review summarized the available information on the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of aspirin by the glycine conjugation pathway. Literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar and the academic journal databases accessible through the North-West University Library. Furthermore, the factors affecting interindividual variation in aspirin metabolism and what is known regarding aspirin toxicity were discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The greatest drawback in understanding the pharmacokinetics of aspirin is the limited information available on the substrate preference of the xenobiotic ligase (ACSM) responsible for activating salicylate to salicyl-CoA. Furthermore, previous pharmacokinetic studies did not consider the contribution of other substrates from the diet or genetic variants, to the detoxification rate of glycine conjugation. Impaired glycine conjugation might contribute to adverse health effects seen in Reye's syndrome and cancer.\n",

      "Abstract: The title of this article is also its punch line. The thesis that I will prove is that every adult, with a few exceptions, should take one 325 mg aspirin tablet each day. The drug is extraordinary and is beneficial in myriad ways. In this dosage the toxicity of the treatment is minimal. Since the drug is sold \"over the counter\", not requiring prescription, it is cheap and its benefits are easily underestimated. I do not use extensive reference citations; but just tell the story of aspirin.\n",

      "Authors: Arnau JM, Agusti A\n",
      "Journal: PharmacoEconomics\n",
      "Publication Date: 1997 Nov\n",
      "Abstract: This article reviews the relevant published literature in order to assess whether aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) is underused in myocardial infarction (MI), taking into account: (i) the evidence of efficacy and safety from clinical trials; (ii) authoritative recommendations about its use; and (iii) published drug-utilisation studies. The use of low-dosage aspirin in the acute phase of MI, and as secondary prevention, should be recommended to all patients who do not have contraindications to the drug. This is a solid evidence-based recommendation with potential benefits that are, at least, similar to those obtained with other standard treatments. As this treatment is well tolerated and inexpensive, it is also assumed that net savings can be achieved. No conventionally used prophylactic aspirin regimen seems to be free from the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity. This is especially important in primary prevention, in which the benefits are small; there is, as yet, no clear evidence that aspirin is indicated for routine use in patients at low risk of occlusive vascular events. We have identified 21 published drug-utilisation studies, and the potential underuse of aspirin in MI was not properly assessed in most of them. In these studies, fairly high aspirin prescription rates were usually documented. However, it seems clear that there is room for improvement, and that a significant proportion of patients who could have benefited from aspirin did not receive it or received less well-studied and more costly drugs. The prescription rates for other drugs with proven efficacy have been lower, and the potential underuse greater, than those documented for aspirin.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Properties that make it toxic:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **High Fluorine Content (Polyfluorinated groups):** The molecule contains several highly fluorinated moieties, specifically a gem-difluorocyclopropane ring and a trifluoromethanesulfonyl group (-S(=O)(=O)C(F)F). While fluorine is often used in medicinal chemistry to improve metabolic stability and bioavailability, excessive or poorly placed fluorination can lead to:\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic burden:** Highly fluorinated compounds can be very metabolically stable, leading to bioaccumulation.\n",
      "    *   **Defluorination and reactive metabolite formation:** Although less common with stable C-F bonds, some fluorinated compounds can undergo defluorination, potentially leading to the formation of reactive intermediates (e.g., acyl fluorides) that can alkylate biomolecules. The trifluoromethanesulfonyl group, while relatively stable, can contribute to strong electron-withdrawing effects across the molecule.\n",
      "    *   **Specific organ toxicities:** Some fluorinated compounds have been linked to liver or kidney toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Sulfonyl Fluoride/Trifluoromethanesulfonyl Group:** The -S(=O)(=O)C(F)F (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) group is a potent electron-drawing group. While used as a strong acid equivalent or a leaving group, it can also act as a Michael acceptor or contribute to electrophilicity in certain contexts. Such groups, especially when connected to aryl rings, can be associated with reactivity alerts or metabolic liabilities, potentially leading to adduct formation with biological nucleophiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hydroxyl Group on a Stereocenter within a Ring (Secondary Alcohol):** The presence of a secondary alcohol (-OH) on a stereocenter within a cyclopropane ring could potentially lead to metabolic transformations (e.g., oxidation to a ketone). While not inherently toxic, its position within a strained, highly fluorinated ring system might influence its metabolic fate and the overall stability of the metabolite.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Cyanide Group (-C#N):** The nitrile group (-C#N) on the fluorinated phenyl ring is a significant concern. Nitriles can be metabolically activated to release cyanide (via cytochrome P450 enzymes), which is highly toxic, inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and cellular respiration. Even if not metabolized to free cyanide, nitriles can sometimes undergo other metabolic transformations or act as electrophiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Aryl Ether Linkage:** The ether linkage (-O-) connecting two substituted aromatic systems, while common, can sometimes be cleaved metabolically, potentially leading to simpler, more reactive phenolic metabolites, especially if the adjacent rings are electron-rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Functional Group Replacements to Mitigate Toxicity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce the toxicity, particularly from the nitrile and highly fluorinated groups, while trying to maintain some desirable physicochemical properties, consider the following replacements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **For the Nitrile (-C#N) Group:**\n",
      "    *   **Amide (-CONH2):** Replaces the electrophilic nitrile with a metabolically stable and polar group. This is a common isostere for nitriles that removes the cyanide release risk.\n",
      "    *   **Tetrazole (C-linked or N-linked):** A bioisostere that is metabolically stable, polar, and can mimic the electronic properties of a carboxylic acid, potentially improving aqueous solubility without the toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH) or Ester (-COOR):** Introduces acidity and polarity, but might alter pKa significantly. Esters can be metabolized to acids.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfate (-OSO3H) or Sulfonamide (-SO2NH2):** Introduces polarity and often improves solubility. Sulfonamides can be metabolically stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **For the Trifluoromethanesulfonyl (-S(=O)(=O)C(F)F) Group:**\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonyl Amide (-S(=O)(=O)NH2):** Replaces the highly fluorinated, potentially reactive group with a more common and generally safer sulfonamide.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfone (-S(=O)(=O)R', where R' is a non-toxic alkyl or aryl group):** Maintains the strong electron-withdrawing nature without the C-F bonds that might be problematic.\n",
      "    *   **Simple Alkyl Sulfonyl (-S(=O)(=O)CH3):** Reduces fluorination while retaining some electron-withdrawing character.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **For the Gem-Difluorocyclopropane Ring:**\n",
      "    *   **Simple Alkyl Chain:** Replacing the ring entirely with a non-fluorinated, flexible alkyl chain (e.g., -CH2CH2CH2-) would drastically alter the conformation and lipophilicity but removes the potentially problematic fluorination.\n",
      "    *   **Non-fluorinated Cycloalkane:** A cyclopropane or cyclobutane ring without the fluorine atoms could maintain some conformational rigidity while removing the C-F bonds.\n",
      "    *   **Methyl groups:** Depending on the steric requirements, substituting the fluorine atoms with methyl groups could be considered.\n",
      "\n",

      "To mitigate the toxicity associated with the aromatic nitro group, the goal is to replace it with a metabolically stable group that can ideally maintain the desired pharmacological activity without the toxic liabilities. Here are some common bioisosteric replacements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Hydrogen (-H)**: If the electronic or steric contribution of the nitro group is not critical for the drug's activity, simply removing it by replacing it with a hydrogen atom is the safest and most direct way to eliminate the toxicophore.\n",
      "2.  **Halogens (e.g., -F, -Cl, -Br)**: Halogen atoms are frequently used as bioisosteres for nitro groups because they are electron-withdrawing and generally metabolically stable. Fluorine is often preferred due to its small size and strong electron-withdrawing effect, sometimes mimicking the electronic properties of a nitro group closely.\n",
      "3.  **Nitrile (-CN)**: This functional group is also electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable, making it a viable option to mimic some of the electronic properties of a nitro group.\n",
      "4.  **Trifluoromethyl (-CF3)**: Already present elsewhere in the molecule, a trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable bioisostere that can be considered for replacing the nitro group, offering similar electronic effects.\n",
      "5.  **Small alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3, -CH2CH3)**: If the primary role of the nitro group was steric bulk rather than electron-withdrawing properties, a small alkyl group could be an option. However, alkyl groups are electron-donating, which is the opposite electronic effect of a nitro group, so this replacement depends heavily on the specific requirements for activity.\n",
      "6.  **Hydroxy group (-OH)**: In some contexts, a hydroxyl group can replace a nitro group, but its properties (e.g., hydrogen bonding, polarity) are quite different, making it a less direct bioisostere in terms of electronic effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most appropriate replacement will depend on the specific structure-activity relationships of the compound and whether the nitro group's electronic or steric properties are essential for its therapeutic effect. Medicinal chemists typically explore a range of these replacements to optimize the balance between efficacy and safety.\n",
