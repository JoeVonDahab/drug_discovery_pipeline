      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aspirin is known for its therapeutic benefits in preventing strokes and relieving pain. However, it is toxic to some individuals, and the biological mechanisms causing toxicity are unknown. Limited literature is available on the role of glycine conjugation as the principal pathway in aspirin detoxification. Previous studies have quantified this two-step enzyme reaction as a singular enzymatic process. Consequently, the individual contributions of these enzymes to the kinetics remain unclear. AREAS COVERED: This review summarized the available information on the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of aspirin by the glycine conjugation pathway. Literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar and the academic journal databases accessible through the North-West University Library. Furthermore, the factors affecting interindividual variation in aspirin metabolism and what is known regarding aspirin toxicity were discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The greatest drawback in understanding the pharmacokinetics of aspirin is the limited information available on the substrate preference of the xenobiotic ligase (ACSM) responsible for activating salicylate to salicyl-CoA. Furthermore, previous pharmacokinetic studies did not consider the contribution of other substrates from the diet or genetic variants, to the detoxification rate of glycine conjugation. Impaired glycine conjugation might contribute to adverse health effects seen in Reye's syndrome and cancer.\n",

      "Title: Is aspirin underused in myocardial infarction?\n",
      "Authors: Arnau JM, Agusti A\n",
      "Journal: PharmacoEconomics\n",
      "Publication Date: 1997 Nov\n",
      "Abstract: This article reviews the relevant published literature in order to assess whether aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) is underused in myocardial infarction (MI), taking into account: (i) the evidence of efficacy and safety from clinical trials; (ii) authoritative recommendations about its use; and (iii) published drug-utilisation studies. The use of low-dosage aspirin in the acute phase of MI, and as secondary prevention, should be recommended to all patients who do not have contraindications to the drug. This is a solid evidence-based recommendation with potential benefits that are, at least, similar to those obtained with other standard treatments. As this treatment is well tolerated and inexpensive, it is also assumed that net savings can be achieved. No conventionally used prophylactic aspirin regimen seems to be free from the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity. This is especially important in primary prevention, in which the benefits are small; there is, as yet, no clear evidence that aspirin is indicated for routine use in patients at low risk of occlusive vascular events. We have identified 21 published drug-utilisation studies, and the potential underuse of aspirin in MI was not properly assessed in most of them. In these studies, fairly high aspirin prescription rates were usually documented. However, it seems clear that there is room for improvement, and that a significant proportion of patients who could have benefited from aspirin did not receive it or received less well-studied and more costly drugs. The prescription rates for other drugs with proven efficacy have been lower, and the potential underuse greater, than those documented for aspirin.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Structural Analysis for Alerts:** Examine the SMILES string for common toxicophores or structural alerts known to be associated with various toxicities (e.g., mutagenicity, genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity). Identify functional groups and substructures that may undergo metabolism to reactive species.\n",
      "2.  **Physicochemical Property Calculation:** Compute properties such as logP (lipophilicity), molecular weight, pKa, TPSA (topological polar surface area), and number of rotatable bonds. These properties influence absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and can indirectly relate to toxicity (e.g., high lipophilicity can lead to accumulation or membrane disruption).\n",
      "3.  **In Silico Toxicity Prediction Models:** Utilize predictive models (e.g., for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity like hERG inhibition) to get an initial assessment. Tools like those based on QSAR, expert rule-based systems (e.g., DEREK, CASE Ultra), or machine learning models trained on large toxicity datasets would be employed.\n",
      "4.  **Metabolic Pathway Prediction:** Anticipate likely metabolic transformations of the molecule, focusing on whether these pathways generate reactive or toxic metabolites (e.g., formation of epoxides, quinone methides, or reactive oxygen species).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Regarding the given drug structure (COc1c(F)cccc1C1=C(c2ccc(O[C@H]3CCN(CCCF)C3)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc2CCC1):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on a visual inspection of the structure and general medicinal chemistry principles, here are some properties or structural features that *could* potentially contribute to toxicity (without definitive prediction):\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fluorine atoms:** There are two fluorine atoms in the molecule: one on a phenyl ring and one on a 3-fluoropropyl chain attached to a piperidine nitrogen. While C-F bonds are generally strong, metabolic defluorination can occur, especially if the carbon bearing the fluorine is subject to oxidation (e.g., the C-F bond on the propyl chain via N-dealkylation or oxidation around the tertiary amine). Release of fluoride ions or formation of fluoroacetate derivatives can be toxic.\n",
      "*   **Tertiary Amine (Piperidine Nitrogen):** The piperidine ring contains a tertiary amine. Tertiary amines are common sites for metabolism (N-oxidation, N-dealkylation) by cytochrome P450 enzymes. These metabolic processes can sometimes lead to the formation of reactive intermediates or alter drug-drug interactions.\n",
      "*   **Highly Conjugated System / Phenolic Hydroxyl:** The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and a phenolic hydroxyl group within a highly conjugated system. Phenols can be oxidized to reactive quinone methides or quinones, especially in highly conjugated systems, which are electrophilic and can bind to proteins or DNA.\n",
      "*   **Overall Lipophilicity:** While not directly calculable without tools, the molecule appears to be relatively lipophilic due to its multiple aromatic rings and the presence of alkyl chains. High lipophilicity can sometimes lead to poor aqueous solubility, accumulation in tissues (e.g., liver, adipose), and potential for membrane disruption or prolonged off-target effects.\n",
      "\n",

      "1.  **Is this drug toxic?**\n",
      "    The drug, represented by the SMILES string `COc1c(F)cccc1C1=C(c2ccc(O[C@H]3CCN(CCCF)C3)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc2CCC1`, has been predicted to be **not mutagenic** by the `ClinToxPred` tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "    However, it's important to understand that a lack of mutagenicity does not equate to a complete absence of all forms of toxicity. Drugs can exhibit other types of toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity), cardiotoxicity (heart toxicity), or nephrotoxicity (kidney toxicity), which are not directly related to mutagenic potential. Due to limitations in the available tools for comprehensive structural analysis of the full molecule for other toxicity types, a definitive overall toxicity assessment beyond mutagenicity cannot be provided at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **If it is toxic, what are the properties that make it toxic?**\n",
      "    While we cannot definitively state that this drug is toxic (beyond being non-mutagenic), we can discuss potential structural features and properties that, in general, **could contribute to toxicity** if it were to manifest:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Fluorine Atoms:** The molecule contains two fluorine atoms: one on an aromatic ring (`COc1c(F)cccc1`) and one on a 3-fluoropropyl chain attached to a piperidine nitrogen (`CCCF`). While C-F bonds are generally strong, in certain metabolic contexts (e.g., oxidative defluorination), they can lead to the formation of reactive intermediates or release of fluoride ions, which can be toxic.\n",
      "    *   **Tertiary Amine (Piperidine Nitrogen):** The piperidine ring contains a tertiary amine. Tertiary amines are common sites for metabolism (e.g., N-oxidation, N-dealkylation) by cytochrome P450 enzymes. These metabolic processes can sometimes generate reactive intermediates (e.g., iminium ions) or alter the drug's pharmacokinetics, potentially contributing to liver burden or drug-drug interactions.\n",
      "    *   **Phenolic Hydroxyl Group:** The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (`c2ccc(O)cc2`) within the extended conjugated system is a structural feature of concern. Phenols can be susceptible to oxidative metabolism, potentially forming reactive quinone methides or quinones. These species are electrophilic and can covalently bind to biological macromolecules (proteins, DNA), leading to cellular damage, which is a known mechanism for certain forms of toxicity, particularly hepatotoxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Overall Lipophilicity and Molecular Size:** The molecule appears to be relatively large and lipophilic due to its multiple aromatic rings and aliphatic chains. High lipophilicity can sometimes lead to accumulation in fatty tissues, poor aqueous solubility, or disruption of cellular membranes, potentially resulting in off-target effects or challenges in excretion. While not a direct toxicophore, it influences ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) and can indirectly contribute to toxicity profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are potential areas of concern based on the chemical structure, but a full toxicological profile would require further in silico predictions, in vitro, and eventually in vivo studies.\n"
