# **Targeted Molecular Docking Workflow for HIF-2Î±**

This document outlines the step-by-step procedure followed to perform targeted molecular docking of ligands against specific residues of the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2-alpha (HIF-2Î±) PAS-B domain. The workflow utilizes UCSF Chimera/ChimeraX for receptor preparation and residue selection, Meeko for preparing receptor PDBQT files and targeted Grid Parameter Files (GPFs), AutoGrid4 for grid map generation, and AutoDock-GPU for the docking calculations.

---

## **1. Software and Environment Setup**

The following software and environment configuration was used:

* **Conda Environment:** A dedicated Conda environment was created to manage dependencies, specifically to resolve version compatibility issues.
    * Python version: 3.10
    * Environment name (example): `meeko_py310`
        ```bash
        # Command to create the environment (example)
        conda create -n meeko_py310 python=3.10
        conda activate meeko_py310
        ```
* **Meeko & RDKit:** Installed into the Conda environment from the `conda-forge` channel. 
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge meeko rdkit
    pip install -U meeko -> upgrade meeko 
    ```
* **AutoDock-GPU:** The GPU-accelerated docking engine. (Assumed to be pre-installed and accessible).
* **AutoGrid4:** Part of the AutoDock4 suite just run:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install autogrid
  ```
* **UCSF Chimera / ChimeraX:** Used for molecular visualization, receptor cleaning, and selection of target residues.

## **2. Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **2.1: Receptor Preparation (General)**

1.  **Obtain Receptor Structure:** A PDB structure of the target receptor is required. For this workflow `5TBM` (HIF-2Î± PAS-B domain) was used as a base.
2.  **Clean Receptor:** Using chimera we removed the chain b, ligand and the solvent using: select then delete commands.
3.  **receptor preparation** In Chimera run Tools -> Structure Editing -> Dock Prep (add hydrogen atoms)
    * **Input file example:** `receptor_ready_5tbm.pdb` (This is the cleaned receptor PDB file).

### **2.2: Identifying and Selecting Target Residues (UCSF Chimera/ChimeraX)**

To focus the docking on a specific binding site within HIF-2Î±, key residues known or hypothesized to interact with inhibitors were selected gathered from the literature:

* **H293:** Direct Bond (H-bond), Allosteric Modulator
* **Y281:** Direct Bond (H-bond network, n â†’ Ï€\*Ar); Allosteric Modulator
* **M252:** Allosteric Modulator, Hydrophobic Pocket Constituent (initially)
* **S304:** Gating Residue, Pocket Architecture
* **G323:** Resistance Mutation Site, Pocket Lining
* **Y278:** Allosteric Modulator, Hydrophobic Pocket Constituent
* **L309:** Hydrophobic Pocket Constituent
* **V321:** Hydrophobic Pocket Constituent
* **F325:** Hydrophobic Pocket Constituent
* **N288:** Gating Residue
* **L272:** Gating Residue
* **A277:** (Primarily for agonist interaction, H-bond with backbone)
* **H248:** Pocket Boundary

**Action:**
Using UCSF Chimera or ChimeraX:
1.  The `receptor_ready_5tbm.pdb` was loaded.
2.  The residues listed above (or a relevant subset defining the entire target cavity) were selected.
3.  Only the atoms of these selected residues were saved to a new PDB file.
    * **Output custom PDB file example:** `custom_residues_5tbm_cleaned.pdb`

### **2.3: Generating a Focused Grid Parameter File (GPF) with Meeko**

Meeko's `mk_prepare_receptor.py` script was used to prepare the full receptor PDBQT and generate a GPF specifically targeted to the selected residues.

**Command Executed:**
```bash
mk_prepare_receptor.py --read_pdb receptor_ready_5tbm.pdb -o myreceptor_targeted -p -g --box_enveloping custom_residues_5tbm_cleaned.pdb --padding 5.0
```
#### **Explanation:**

* `--read_pdb receptor_ready_5tbm.pdb`: Specifies the input full receptor PDB.
* `-o myreceptor_targeted`: Sets the output basename for generated files.
* `-p`: Instructs Meeko to write the prepared receptor PDBQT file.
* `-g`: Instructs Meeko to write the Grid Parameter File (.gpf).
* `--box_enveloping custom_residues_5tbm_cleaned.pdb`: Crucially, uses the PDB file of selected residues to define the grid box center and base dimensions.
* `--padding 5.0`: Adds 5.0 Ã… padding around the selected residues.

#### **Output Files from this step:**

* `myreceptor_targeted.pdbqt`: The full receptor prepared in PDBQT format.
* `myreceptor_targeted.gpf`: The AutoGrid Parameter File, with grid dimensions centered on the selected residues.
* `myreceptor_targeted.box.pdb`: A PDB file representing the grid box for visualization.
* `boron-silicon-atom_par.dat`: Atomic parameters for B and Si.

### **2.5: Correcting the Grid Parameter File (GPF)**

An error was encountered when initially running `autogrid4`: `"autogrid4: ERROR: Too many "map" keywords (...); the "ligand_types" command declares only (...) atom types."` This indicated a mismatch between the number of atom types listed in the `ligand_types` line and the number of `map` lines in the `myreceptor_targeted.gpf` file, or that the total number of unique types exceeded AutoGrid's limit (often around 14 for atom-specific affinity maps).

**Original problematic `ligand_types` line (example from troubleshooting):**

Contained 17 type labels, with duplicates like `Cl` and `CL`)

**Correction Made:**
The `myreceptor_targeted.gpf` file was manually edited:

1.  The `ligand_types` line was corrected to remove duplicate/case-variant types (e.g., `CL` was removed, keeping `Cl`; `BR` was removed, keeping `Br`).
2.  To ensure the number of types was within AutoGrid's limit (~14 types, as you found worked), types like `Si` and `B` were also removed from the `ligand_types` line (assuming they are not essential for the specific receptor/ligands in this study).
    * **final file can be found in the dictionary:
* `-`: myreceptor_targeted.glg
### **2.6: Then autogrid and docking commands:**
```bash
autogrid4 -p myreceptor_targeted.gpf -l myreceptor_targeted.glg
bash run_docking_batch.sh
```
### **2.7: Finally the output file was converted to pdbqt using:**
```bash
bash convert_dlgs_to_pdbqt.sh
```
* it requires MGLToolsPckgs, to install run either:
```bash
  conda install bioconda::mgltools
   conda install bioconda/label/cf201901::mgltools
```
