      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aspirin is known for its therapeutic benefits in preventing strokes and relieving pain. However, it is toxic to some individuals, and the biological mechanisms causing toxicity are unknown. Limited literature is available on the role of glycine conjugation as the principal pathway in aspirin detoxification. Previous studies have quantified this two-step enzyme reaction as a singular enzymatic process. Consequently, the individual contributions of these enzymes to the kinetics remain unclear. AREAS COVERED: This review summarized the available information on the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of aspirin by the glycine conjugation pathway. Literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar and the academic journal databases accessible through the North-West University Library. Furthermore, the factors affecting interindividual variation in aspirin metabolism and what is known regarding aspirin toxicity were discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The greatest drawback in understanding the pharmacokinetics of aspirin is the limited information available on the substrate preference of the xenobiotic ligase (ACSM) responsible for activating salicylate to salicyl-CoA. Furthermore, previous pharmacokinetic studies did not consider the contribution of other substrates from the diet or genetic variants, to the detoxification rate of glycine conjugation. Impaired glycine conjugation might contribute to adverse health effects seen in Reye's syndrome and cancer.\n",

      "Abstract: The title of this article is also its punch line. The thesis that I will prove is that every adult, with a few exceptions, should take one 325 mg aspirin tablet each day. The drug is extraordinary and is beneficial in myriad ways. In this dosage the toxicity of the treatment is minimal. Since the drug is sold \"over the counter\", not requiring prescription, it is cheap and its benefits are easily underestimated. I do not use extensive reference citations; but just tell the story of aspirin.\n",

      "Authors: Arnau JM, Agusti A\n",
      "Journal: PharmacoEconomics\n",
      "Publication Date: 1997 Nov\n",
      "Abstract: This article reviews the relevant published literature in order to assess whether aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) is underused in myocardial infarction (MI), taking into account: (i) the evidence of efficacy and safety from clinical trials; (ii) authoritative recommendations about its use; and (iii) published drug-utilisation studies. The use of low-dosage aspirin in the acute phase of MI, and as secondary prevention, should be recommended to all patients who do not have contraindications to the drug. This is a solid evidence-based recommendation with potential benefits that are, at least, similar to those obtained with other standard treatments. As this treatment is well tolerated and inexpensive, it is also assumed that net savings can be achieved. No conventionally used prophylactic aspirin regimen seems to be free from the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity. This is especially important in primary prevention, in which the benefits are small; there is, as yet, no clear evidence that aspirin is indicated for routine use in patients at low risk of occlusive vascular events. We have identified 21 published drug-utilisation studies, and the potential underuse of aspirin in MI was not properly assessed in most of them. In these studies, fairly high aspirin prescription rates were usually documented. However, it seems clear that there is room for improvement, and that a significant proportion of patients who could have benefited from aspirin did not receive it or received less well-studied and more costly drugs. The prescription rates for other drugs with proven efficacy have been lower, and the potential underuse greater, than those documented for aspirin.\n",

      "**Properties that make it toxic:**\n",
      "The toxicity is likely attributed to two key functional groups present in the molecule:\n",
      "1.  **Nitro group (`-NO2`)**: The presence of a nitro group, particularly on an aromatic ring, is a well-known structural alert for toxicity. Nitro groups can be metabolically reduced *in vivo* by nitroreductases to form highly reactive intermediates such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, and ultimately amine derivatives. These reactive intermediates can cause oxidative stress, damage cellular macromolecules (like DNA and proteins), leading to genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity.\n",
      "2.  **Aromatic Amine (`-NH-Ar`)**: The molecule contains an aromatic amine linkage (specifically, a secondary aromatic amine). Aromatic amines are often metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2) to form reactive N-hydroxylated metabolites. These N-hydroxylated metabolites can then undergo further activation (e.g., by N-acetyltransferases or sulfotransferases) to highly electrophilic species that bind covalently to DNA, leading to DNA adduct formation, which is a major mechanism of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of both a nitro group and an aromatic amine in the same molecule significantly increases the likelihood of toxicity due to potential synergistic effects or parallel metabolic activation pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested functional group replacements:**\n",
      "To reduce the toxicity while potentially retaining or improving drug properties, the following functional group replacements can be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **For the Nitro Group (`-NO2`):**\n",
      "    *   **Cyano group (`-CN`)**: A cyano group is often used as a bioisostere for nitro groups. It is generally less prone to metabolic reduction and reactive intermediate formation compared to nitro groups.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonyl fluoride (`-SO2F`)**: This group is chemically reactive but often used in covalent inhibitors, and its toxicity profile would need careful evaluation depending on the target interaction. However, it's not a direct bioisostere for electronic properties like a nitro group.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonyl group (`-SO2R`)**: While not a direct bioisostere, replacing a nitro group with a sulfonyl group (e.g., methylsulfonyl `-SO2CH3`) can alter electronic properties and metabolic fate.\n",
      "    *   **Trifluoromethyl group (`-CF3`)**: This group is electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable, often used to improve pharmacokinetic properties, and can sometimes serve as a replacement for problematic electron-withdrawing groups.\n",
      "    *   **Halogens (e.g., `-Cl`, `-F`)**: Halogens are electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable, often used to tune lipophilicity and electronic properties, and are generally safer than nitro groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **For the Aromatic Amine (`-NH-Ar`):**\n",
      "    *   **Amide linkage (`-NHCO-`, `-CONH-`)**: Replacing the secondary amine with an amide linkage can significantly reduce metabolic activation leading to reactive metabolites. Amides are much more stable to N-oxidation and are less likely to form DNA-reactive electrophiles.\n",
      "    *   **Ether linkage (`-O-`)**: If the linker's electronic and conformational flexibility allow, an ether linkage can replace the amine, removing the problematic nitrogen atom.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonamide linkage (`-NHSO2-`, `-SO2NH-`)**: Sulfonamides are generally more metabolically stable than simple amines and are less prone to oxidative activation at the nitrogen.\n",
      "    *   **Alkyl linker (e.g., `-CH2-CH2-`)**: Replacing the amine with a metabolically stable alkyl chain could be an option if the spatial and electronic requirements are not strict for the nitrogen atom.\n",
      "    *   **Heterocyclic rings (e.g., a furan or thiophene ring as a linker)**: Sometimes, replacing a problematic linker with a stable, non-metabolized heterocyclic ring can maintain spatial orientation while removing the toxicophore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of replacement will depend on the specific role of these groups in the molecule's interaction with its biological target (e.g., electronic properties, hydrogen bonding, lipophilicity, steric bulk). Bioisosteric replacement strategies should be carefully considered to maintain efficacy while improving the safety profile. Further *in silico* and *in vitro* testing of the modified compounds would be crucial to confirm reduced toxicity and retained activity.\n",

This DNA damage is a major mechanism contributing to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The co-occurrence of both a nitro group and an aromatic amine in the same molecule often exacerbates the toxic potential due to potentially converging or synergistic metabolic activation pathways.\n",

      "**Suggested functional group replacements to mitigate toxicity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce the toxic profile while aiming to maintain or improve the drug's therapeutic properties, consider replacing the problematic functional groups with safer bioisosteres:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **For the Nitro Group (`-NO2`):**\n",
      "    *   **Cyano group (`-CN`)**: This is a common bioisostere for the nitro group. It is electron-withdrawing and generally metabolically stable, reducing the likelihood of reactive intermediate formation.\n",
      "    *   **Trifluoromethyl group (`-CF3`)**: Also electron-withdrawing and metabolically stable, it can sometimes mimic the electronic and steric properties of a nitro group without its metabolic liabilities.\n",
      "    *   **Halogens (e.g., `-F`, `-Cl`)**: These are metabolically stable, electron-withdrawing, and can be used to tune electronic properties and lipophilicity.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonyl derivatives (e.g., `-SO2CH3`)**: While not a direct electronic mimic, a methylsulfonyl group can sometimes provide electron-withdrawing character without the inherent toxicity of a nitro group.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **For the Aromatic Amine (`-NH-Ar`):**\n",
      "    *   **Amide linkage (`-NHCO-` or `-CONH-`)**: Replacing the secondary amine with an amide linkage is a highly effective strategy. Amides are significantly more stable to N-oxidation and are much less likely to form reactive, DNA-damaging metabolites. This is one of the most common and effective ways to detoxify aromatic amine-containing compounds.\n",
      "    *   **Ether linkage (`-O-`)**: If the electronic and conformational requirements of the linker allow, an oxygen atom can replace the nitrogen, completely removing the problematic amine functionality.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonamide linkage (`-NHSO2-` or `-SO2NH-`)**: Sulfonamides are generally more metabolically stable than simple amines and are less prone to oxidative activation at the nitrogen atom.\n",
      "    *   **Alkyl linker (e.g., `-CH2-CH2-`)**: If the nitrogen's specific electronic and hydrogen-bonding roles are not critical, replacing the entire amine with a metabolically stable carbon chain could be an option.\n",
      "    *   **Incorporation into a stable heterocyclic ring**: In some cases, the nitrogen might be incorporated into a less reactive, metabolically stable heterocyclic ring system if the overall structure permits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of replacement should be guided by careful consideration of how these modifications will affect the molecule's interaction with its biological target (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electronic properties, lipophilicity, steric bulk) to ensure that efficacy is maintained or improved while significantly reducing toxicity. Further *in silico* and *in vitro* studies would be essential to validate the safety and efficacy of any modified compounds.\n",

      "1.  **Nitrile Group (-C≡N):** Nitrile groups are a significant concern due to their potential for metabolic conversion to cyanide, a potent mitochondrial toxin. This can lead to various systemic toxicities, including cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "2.  **Highly Fluorinated Aromatic Ring:** While fluorine substitution is common in medicinal chemistry to modulate properties like lipophilicity and metabolic stability, extensive or specific patterns of fluorination, especially in aromatic systems, can sometimes lead to adverse effects. For instance, defluorination can occur metabolically, leading to reactive intermediates or fluoride release, which can be toxic. In this case, the `Oc2cc(F)cc(C#N)c2` portion features multiple fluorine atoms on an aromatic ring.\n",
      "3.  **Sulfonyl Group (-SO2-):** Sulfonyl groups themselves are generally considered relatively safe and are present in many approved drugs (e.g., sulfonamides, COX-2 inhibitors). However, in certain contexts, they can be associated with idiosyncratic reactions, hypersensitivity, or, less commonly, metabolic liabilities. Their contribution to overall toxicity depends on the entire molecular context.\n",
      "4.  **Alpha-fluoro alcohol (adjacent to the fused ring system):** The presence of an alpha-fluoro alcohol `[C@@H]2F` adjacent to the hydroxyl group `[C@H](O)` within the fused bicyclic system could potentially lead to issues if defluorination occurs, forming a reactive carbonyl or other toxic metabolites.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: PrestoBlue is a new resazurin based reagent to assess cell viability and cytotoxicity. It is claimed to be a fast and highly sensitive assay. Here, we compared PrestoBlue, alamarBlue, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazonium bromide (MTT) in assessing cell viability of human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC), and investigated the effect of plate color, reading mode, and plate storage on the performance of PrestoBlue assay. METHODS: The viability of different numbers of healthy HCEC and the toxicity of various chemicals on HCEC were evaluated using PrestoBlue (fluorescence), alamarBlue (fluorescence), and MTT (absorbance). The sensitivities of the three assays were compared. In the PrestoBlue assay, three plate colors and two reading modes were used and compared in assessing the toxic effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The PrestoBlue solutions after reaction were stored and measured on day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. The fluorescence readings obtained on different days were then compared. RESULTS: Both PrestoBlue and alamarBlue were able to detect 5000 healthy cells after 30min incubation and 1000 cells after 1h, 2h, and 4h incubation; while MTT was able to detect 5000 cells after 3h incubation. In the assessment of the toxicity of various chemicals, PrestoBlue and alamarBlue performed similarly. There was no significant difference between the results obtained by these two reagents. All the three plate colors and two reading modes showed similar results in the PrestoBlue assay in assessing the toxicity of SDS. Plate storage up to 7days did not affect the result of the PrestoBlue assay. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that in evaluating the viability of HCEC, PrestoBlue is more sensitive than MTT, but similar to alamarBlue. The plate color, reading mode and plate storage up to 7days did not affect the performance of the PrestoBlue assay.\n",

      "Abstract: Tetrazoles and their derivatives possess various biological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-fungal, and other activities. However, these compounds may induce specific cumulative and toxic effects in living organisms. Therefore, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were constructed to study the acute oral toxicity of tetrazoles in rats and mice. The toxicity data of 111 tetrazole compounds were collected using the ChemIDplus, ChEMBL and ECHA databases as response variables, while the PaDEL-descriptor generated the 2D descriptors as independent variables. The models were developed and validated following the OECD guidelines by the DTC-QSAR tool. Three QSAR models were successfully established for the oral routes of rat and mouse and the intraperitoneal route of mouse, respectively. The scatter plots showed high consistency between the training and test data sets. All the models successfully met the external and internal validation criteria. Most of the descriptors kept in the final models exhibited positive correlations with toxicity, whereas only 6 descriptors exhibited negative associations. Several chemicals were identified as response or structural outliers, based on the standardized residuals and leverage values. In conclusion, the findings of this investigation demonstrate that the proposed QSAR models hold promise in forecasting the acute toxicity of recently developed or synthesized tetrazole compounds, thereby mitigating potential risks to human health and the environment.\n",

      "Abstract: Cancer is one of the main causes of death throughout the world. The anticancer agents are indispensable for the treatment of various cancers, but most of them currently on the market are not specific, resulting in series of side effects of chemotherapy. Moreover, the emergency of drug-resistance towards cancers has already increased up to alarming level in the recent decades. Therefore, it's imperative to develop novel anticancer candidates with excellent activity against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant cancers, and low toxicity as well. Tetrazole is the bioisoster of carboxylic acid, and its derivatives demonstrated promising anticancer activity. Hybridization of tetrazole with other anticancer pharmacophores may provide novel candidates with anticancer potency. The present review described the anticancer activity of tetrazole hybrids, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) is also discussed to provide an insight for rational designs of tetrazole anticancer candidates with higher efficiency.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Properties Contributing to Toxicity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Brominated Phenyl Group:** Organobromine compounds, particularly aromatic ones, can be metabolically activated in the body. This activation often leads to the formation of reactive intermediates, such as epoxides or radical species, which can cause oxidative stress, damage to cellular macromolecules (like DNA and proteins) through covalent binding, and lead to various toxic effects including hepatotoxicity or genotoxicity. While not explicitly detailed in the provided PubMed abstracts for *organobromine compounds*, this is a well-established mechanism in medicinal chemistry.\n",
      "2.  **Tetrazole Ring:** The tetrazole moiety itself can contribute to toxicity. As indicated by the PubMed search (Article 2, PMID: 38042272), tetrazole compounds \"may induce specific cumulative and toxic effects in living organisms,\" and QSAR models are used to predict their acute toxicity. This suggests that the tetrazole ring is not always metabolically benign and can be associated with adverse outcomes.\n",

      "**Suggested Functional Group Replacements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the potential toxicity, the following replacements for the identified toxic sections could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **For the Brominated Phenyl Group (Br replacement):**\n",
      "    *   **Hydrogen (-H):** A direct replacement with hydrogen would remove the halogen and its associated metabolic activation risk.\n",
      "    *   **Fluorine (-F):** Fluorine is a common bioisostere for hydrogen that can maintain lipophilicity and modulate electronic properties, often without the same metabolic liabilities as heavier halogens like bromine. It is generally more metabolically stable.\n",
      "    *   **Methyl Group (-CH3):** A small alkyl group could also replace the bromine, altering lipophilicity and electronic effects while removing the halogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **For the Tetrazole Ring:**\n",
      "    *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** The tetrazole is a bioisostere of a carboxylic acid (as mentioned in Article 3, PMID: 31200236). Replacing the tetrazole with a carboxylic acid group could maintain similar acidic and hydrogen-bonding properties, though pKa and permeability might differ.\n",
      "    *   **Other Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles:**\n",
      "        *   **1,2,3-Triazole or 1,2,4-Triazole:** These are common bioisosteric replacements for tetrazoles, often exhibiting improved metabolic stability and lower toxicity profiles.\n",
      "        *   **Oxadiazoles or Thiadiazoles (e.g., 1,3,4-Oxadiazole, 1,2,4-Oxadiazole, 1,3,4-Thiadiazole):** These five-membered heterocyclic rings can mimic some of the electronic and hydrogen-bonding properties of the tetrazole, while potentially offering better metabolic stability and reduced toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonamide (-SO2NH2):** If the tetrazole's role is primarily as an acidic hydrogen bond donor, a sulfonamide could be a bioisosteric option, although its pKa and molecular interactions would need careful consideration.\n",
      "\n",

Then, I'll consult toxicity prediction databases or literature to assess the known toxicophores present and confirm potential toxicity, specifically focusing on the nitro, trifluoromethyl, and hydrazine-like moieties. Finally, I will suggest bioisosteric or analogous replacements for identified toxic sections based on medicinal chemistry principles.\n",

      "1.  **Nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring:** Aromatic nitro compounds are often reduced *in vivo* by nitroreductases to highly reactive intermediates, such as nitroso, hydroxylamino, and amino derivatives, which can undergo redox cycling, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), cause oxidative stress, and lead to DNA damage, protein adduction, and hepatotoxicity. Some are also carcinogenic or mutagenic.\n",
      "2.  **Hydrazine linkage (-N-N-):** Hydrazine derivatives can be metabolically activated to electrophilic species that bind covalently to macromolecules (DNA, proteins), leading to liver damage, hemolysis, and genotoxicity. They can also inhibit enzymes (e.g., monoamine oxidase).\n",
      "3.  **Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on an aromatic ring:** While often used to increase lipophilicity and metabolic stability, a trifluoromethyl group can sometimes be metabolically defluorinated, leading to reactive intermediates or fluoride release, which can be toxic. In this specific context, its primary contribution to toxicity might be secondary to the nitro and hydrazine groups, but it's a consideration.\n",

      "The properties that make it toxic are primarily associated with specific functional groups:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Nitro group (-NO2) on an aromatic ring:** Aromatic nitro compounds are often reduced *in vivo* by nitroreductases to highly reactive intermediates (e.g., nitroso, hydroxylamino, amino derivatives). These intermediates can undergo redox cycling, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), cause oxidative stress, lead to DNA damage, protein adduction, and may result in hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, or carcinogenicity.\n",
      "2.  **Hydrazine linkage (-N-N-):** Hydrazine derivatives can be metabolically activated to electrophilic species that bind covalently to biological macromolecules (such as DNA and proteins). This covalent binding can lead to various forms of toxicity, including liver damage, hemolysis, and genotoxicity. They can also inhibit enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase.\n",
      "3.  **Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on an aromatic ring:** While frequently used to enhance lipophilicity and metabolic stability, in certain contexts, a trifluoromethyl group can undergo metabolic defluorination. This process can lead to the formation of reactive intermediates or the release of fluoride ions, both of which can be toxic. However, in this specific molecule, the nitro and hydrazine groups are generally considered more potent toxicophores.\n",

      "1.  **For the Nitro Group (-NO2):**\n",
      "    *   **Amide (-CONH2):** Retains hydrogen bonding capabilities and is generally much less toxic.\n",
      "    *   **Cyano (-CN):** Electron-withdrawing and relatively stable, often used as a bioisostere.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonyl (-SO2R) or Methyl Sulfone (-SO2CH3):** Electron-withdrawing groups that can mimic some electronic properties of the nitro group.\n",
      "    *   **Triazole (e.g., 1,2,3-triazole or 1,2,4-triazole):** Aromatic heterocycles that can mimic electron-withdrawing and hydrogen-bonding characteristics while being metabolically stable.\n",
      "    *   **Carbonyl (C=O) derivatives:** In some contexts, a ketone or aldehyde might be considered if the electronic and steric requirements allow, though less common as a direct nitro replacement.\n",
      "    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH) or ester (-COOR):** These introduce different acidity/lipophilicity profiles but can be considered if the overall electronic and steric requirements for activity permit.\n",

      "\n",
      "The toxicity of this compound can be attributed to several properties, primarily its molecular structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Fused Tetrazole Ring System:** The compound features a 1,2,3,4-tetrazole ring fused to a 5-membered nitrogen-containing ring (likely a pyrrolidine derivative).\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic Instability:** While some tetrazoles are stable, this specific fused arrangement, especially with multiple adjacent nitrogens and the direct fusion to a nitrogen in the other ring, can lead to metabolic instability. Such systems might undergo enzymatic cleavage (e.g., by reductases or oxidases), leading to the formation of reactive intermediates like diazo compounds, highly reactive imines, or other electrophilic species that can interact with biological macromolecules (DNA, proteins), causing toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Electron Properties:** The high density of nitrogen atoms within the fused system can make the ring system electron-deficient, potentially increasing its reactivity with biological nucleophiles, or conversely, making it susceptible to reduction and subsequent reactivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **High Lipophilicity:** The presence of two large phenyl groups significantly increases the molecule's lipophilicity (fat-solubility). High lipophilicity can lead to:\n",
      "    *   **Poor Aqueous Solubility:** Hindering formulation and absorption.\n",
      "    *   **Non-specific Binding:** Increased binding to plasma proteins and cell membranes, leading to off-target effects and reduced free drug concentration at the target site.\n",
      "    *   **Accumulation:** Tendency to accumulate in fatty tissues (e.g., liver, brain), potentially leading to prolonged exposure and organ toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Slow Clearance:** Difficult excretion from the body, leading to higher systemic exposure over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Lack of Readily Metabolizable Groups:** Beyond the potential metabolic vulnerability of the fused tetrazole itself, the molecule lacks obvious \"soft spots\" for facile Phase I (e.g., hydroxylation of alkyl chains or aromatic rings) or Phase II (e.g., glucuronidation, sulfation of hydroxyl groups) metabolism, which are crucial for rendering drugs more water-soluble for excretion. This could contribute to its accumulation and prolonged systemic exposure, increasing the risk of toxicity.\n",

      "**Suggested Functional Group Replacements to Reduce Toxicity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the identified toxic properties, the following functional group modifications are suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **To Address the Fused Tetrazole System:**\n",
      "    *   **Replace the Tetrazole with More Stable Fused Heterocycles:**\n",
      "        *   **Fused Pyrazole:** Replacing the tetrazole with a fused pyrazole (e.g., at the N-C bond shared with the pyrrolidine) would reduce the nitrogen count and often lead to more metabolically stable systems.\n",
      "        *   **Fused Imidazole or Triazole (e.g., 1,2,4-triazole):** These options still maintain an aromatic nitrogen heterocycle but have different electronic and metabolic profiles that might be less problematic than the tetrazole.\n",
      "    *   **Simplify the Core Structure:** If the entire fused bicyclic system is problematic, consider breaking the fusion and replacing the entire core with a simpler, non-fused nitrogen heterocycle (e.g., a substituted pyrrolidine or piperidine ring) to reduce structural complexity and potential reactivity. This would likely require a complete re-design for target binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **To Address High Lipophilicity:**\n",
      "    *   **Replace Phenyl Rings with Polar Aromatic Heterocycles:**\n",
      "        *   **Pyridine, Pyrimidine, Pyrazine:** Replacing one or both phenyl rings with nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles increases polarity, improves aqueous solubility, and can introduce additional sites for H-bonding.\n",
      "        *   **Furan, Thiophene:** These are less lipophilic than phenyl rings but still aromatic and can maintain some electronic properties.\n",
      "    *   **Introduce Polar Functional Groups:** Add hydrophilic groups to the existing phenyl rings or the heterocyclic core at metabolically stable positions.\n",
      "        *   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** Improves solubility and provides a site for glucuronidation/sulfation.\n",
      "        *   **Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):** Significantly increases polarity due to ionization.\n",
      "        *   **Amine (-NH2, -NHR, -NR2):** Primary, secondary, or tertiary amines increase polarity and basicity; however, careful consideration of basicity and metabolic stability is needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Aromatic Nitro Group (O=[N+]([O-])-Ar):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Aromatic nitro groups are often metabolically reduced by nitroreductases (e.g., cytochrome P450 reductases, bacterial nitroreductases) in the liver and gut microbiome. This reduction can lead to the formation of highly reactive intermediates such as nitroso (Ar-NO), hydroxylamine (Ar-NHOH), and ultimately aniline derivatives (Ar-NH2).\n",
      "    *   **Toxicity:**\n",
      "        *   **Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity:** The nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates can act as electrophiles, binding covalently to cellular macromolecules like DNA and proteins. This adduction can lead to DNA damage (e.g., mutations, strand breaks), which is a major contributor to genotoxicity and potential carcinogenicity.\n",
      "        *   **Methemoglobinemia:** Some aromatic nitro compounds can cause methemoglobinemia by oxidizing the ferrous iron (Fe2+) in hemoglobin to ferric iron (Fe3+), thereby impairing oxygen transport in the blood.\n",
      "        *   **Oxidative Stress:** The redox cycling of nitro compounds can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and cellular damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Secondary Aromatic Amine Linker (Ar-NH-Ar'):**\n",
      "    *   **Mechanism:** Aromatic amines, especially secondary ones, are susceptible to metabolic activation through N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP3A4) in the liver. This forms N-hydroxyarylamine intermediates (Ar-NHOH-Ar'), which are often unstable and can undergo further activation, for instance, through O-acetylation by N-acetyltransferases or sulfonation by sulfotransferases, to highly reactive nitrenium ions (Ar-N+=Ar').\n",
      "    *   **Toxicity:**\n",
      "        *   **Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity:** The resulting nitrenium ions are strong electrophiles that readily react with DNA and proteins, forming covalent adducts. This DNA damage is a well-established mechanism of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, particularly observed in bladder and liver cancers with some aromatic amines.\n",

      "    *   **Halogen Atoms (e.g., -Cl, -F):** Depending on the desired electronic properties, halogens can be used as more metabolically stable electron-withdrawing replacements.\n",
      "    *   **Stable Heterocycles:** Incorporation of bioisosteric heterocycles like oxadiazole, tetrazole, or pyrazole rings can mimic the steric and electronic features of the nitro group while offering better metabolic stability and reduced toxicity risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **For the Secondary Aromatic Amine Linker:**\n",
      "    *   **Amide Linker (-CONH- or -NHCO-):** Amides are significantly more metabolically stable than secondary amines due to the resonance stabilization of the nitrogen atom, which reduces its nucleophilicity and susceptibility to N-hydroxylation.\n",
      "    *   **Sulfonamide Linker (-SO2NH- or -NHSO2-):** Similar to amides, sulfonamides are metabolically more stable and less prone to oxidative activation compared to amines.\n",
      "    *   **Ether Linker (-O-):** Replacing the -NH- with an oxygen atom (-O-) can remove the metabolically labile hydrogen and nitrogen, thereby eliminating the risk of N-hydroxylation and subsequent activation.\n",
      "    *   **Methylene Linker (-CH2-):** A methylene bridge can replace the amine, though its metabolic stability and electronic properties would need careful consideration.\n",

It also has an ionizable amine group (pKa ~4-5) and a nitro group. Prediction might suggest reasonable but not excellent oral absorption, possibly limited by permeability or efflux. It likely passes Lipinski's Rule of 5 (MW < 500, HBD < 5, HBA < 10, LogP < 5), suggesting good drug-likeness for oral administration. Caco-2 permeability would likely be moderate. Human Intestinal Absorption (HIA) would probably be predicted as moderate to good.\n",

      "    *   **Plasma Protein Binding (PPB):** Due to its lipophilicity and potential for hydrogen bonding, it would likely exhibit high plasma protein binding (>90%).\n",
      "    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeation:** Given its lipophilicity and size, it might have some BBB penetration, but the nitro group and the overall size could limit it. It's unlikely to be a P-gp substrate.\n",
      "    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** Due to high lipophilicity and high PPB, it might have a moderate to high volume of distribution, indicating distribution into tissues.\n",
      "*   **Metabolism:**\n",
      "    *   **CYP Interactions:** The presence of an aniline moiety makes it susceptible to N-oxidation and potentially N-dealkylation if a suitable alkyl group were present (which it isn't here). The nitro group can be reduced. It might be a substrate for some CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2D6) and potentially an inhibitor of some, depending on its specific binding. The chlorine substituent can make it more resistant to oxidation in that part of the molecule but might direct metabolism elsewhere.\n",

This suggests a moderate to high volume of distribution, indicating significant distribution into tissues. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is possible but might be limited by its size and specific interactions.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Predicted PK Properties:**\n",

      "1.  **Absorption (A):**\n",
      "    *   **Oral Bioavailability:** The prediction from Observation 1 indicates an oral bioavailability < 20%. This suggests poor absorption, possibly due to low solubility, high first-pass metabolism, or efflux pump activity.\n",
      "    *   **Lipophilicity:** The presence of the fluorinated benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) and the secondary amine linker suggests it will be reasonably lipophilic. However, the nitroxide and the fused oxadiazole ring might add some polarity. High lipophilicity can sometimes hinder aqueous solubility and thus absorption.\n",
      "    *   **Molecular Weight:** (Calculated: ~400 g/mol) This is within a range generally permissible for oral absorption, but other factors are likely dominant.\n",
      "    *   **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** The secondary amine can act as a hydrogen bond donor, and the nitro group, oxadiazole, and fluorines can act as acceptors. An imbalance or high number of H-bonds can affect permeability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Distribution (D):**\n",
      "    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** Given the likely lipophilicity, the drug is expected to have a moderate to high volume of distribution, meaning it may distribute into tissues rather than primarily staying in plasma.\n",
      "    *   **Plasma Protein Binding:** The lipophilic nature and the presence of basic nitrogen (secondary amine) suggest it may exhibit moderate to high plasma protein binding, primarily to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.\n",

      "3.  **Metabolism (M):**\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic Pathways:**\n",
      "        *   **Nitro Group:** The nitro group (O=[N+]([O-]) ) can be a site for reduction to an amine, potentially by nitroreductases, leading to an active or inactive metabolite, and possibly toxicity if the resulting amine is reactive.\n",
      "        *   **Secondary Amine:** The -NH- linker is a common site for N-dealkylation or oxidation (e.g., by CYP enzymes) forming hydroxylated or N-oxidized metabolites.\n",
      "        *   **Aromatic Rings:** The fluorinated benzene ring and the fused oxadiazole ring could potentially undergo aromatic hydroxylation, although the fluorine atoms would deactivate the ring to electrophilic attack. The trifluoromethyl group is generally metabolically stable but can sometimes undergo defluorination in specific contexts.\n",
      "        *   **Oxadiazole Ring:** While generally stable, some heterocycles can undergo oxidative cleavage or ring-opening reactions.\n",
      "    *   **First-Pass Metabolism:** Given the low predicted oral bioavailability, significant first-pass metabolism is highly probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Excretion (E):**\n",
      "    *   **Renal/Biliary Excretion:** Excretion will depend on the extent of metabolism and the polarity of the metabolites. More polar, hydrophilic metabolites would likely be excreted renally (via urine), while larger, more lipophilic conjugates might be excreted renally or via bile into feces.\n",
      "    *   **Half-life (t½):** The half-life would be influenced by the rate of metabolism and excretion. If metabolism is extensive and rapid, the half-life could be short.\n",

      "**Overall Assessment:**\n",
      "This drug structure presents challenges for oral administration due to predicted low bioavailability. It likely undergoes significant metabolism, particularly at the nitro group and the secondary amine. Its lipophilicity suggests tissue distribution and plasma protein binding. Further in vitro and in vivo studies would be crucial to fully characterize its complex PK profile and to understand the implications of potential reactive metabolites from the nitro group reduction.\n",

Without specific computational tools or experimental data, these are predictions:\n",

This suggests a potential for good passive diffusion across membranes, hinting at decent oral bioavailability, assuming sufficient aqueous solubility.\n",

      "    *   **Permeability:** While the lipophilic nature might suggest good permeability, the low bioavailability indicates that permeability might be compromised (e.g., by efflux) or, more likely, that solubility or first-pass metabolism are the dominant limiting factors for oral absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Distribution (D):**\n",
      "    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd):** The molecule still appears to be relatively lipophilic due to the halogenated phenyl group and fused ring system. This lipophilicity generally favors distribution into tissues, suggesting a moderate to high volume of distribution.\n",
      "    *   **Plasma Protein Binding (PPB):** Highly lipophilic and structurally complex molecules often exhibit high plasma protein binding. Significant binding to plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein) is anticipated, which would reduce the free (active) drug concentration in plasma.\n",
      "    *   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeation:** The balance of lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding potential might allow for some BBB penetration. However, if it's a substrate for efflux transporters in the gut, it might also be a substrate for similar transporters at the BBB, limiting brain exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Metabolism (M):**\n",
      "    *   **Metabolic Stability:** This remains a critical aspect given the potential for low oral bioavailability. The structure presents multiple potential sites for enzymatic metabolism:\n",
      "        *   **Secondary Amine (-CH2-NH-):** Susceptible to oxidative N-dealkylation, a common metabolic pathway leading to the removal of the halogenated benzyl group.\n",
      "        *   **Nitro Group (-NO2):** Can undergo reduction to an amino group, followed by further metabolic steps like acetylation.\n",
      "        *   **Aromatic Rings:** The halogenated phenyl and the nitrophenyl rings are candidates for oxidative hydroxylation.\n",
      "        *   **Fused Heterocyclic System:** The complex fused `nonc` system (likely a pyrimidine fused with another heterocycle) might be metabolically stable or could undergo specific enzymatic transformations depending on its exact nature (e.g., oxidation of nitrogen atoms, ring opening).\n",
      "    *   **First-Pass Metabolism:** The predicted low oral bioavailability strongly points to *extensive first-pass metabolism* as a very probable major contributor, meaning a significant fraction of the drug is metabolized by the liver before it reaches the systemic circulation after oral absorption.\n",
      "    *   **CYP Interactions:** The presence of aromatic and heterocyclic systems suggests a potential for interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), possibly as an inhibitor or inducer, which could lead to drug-drug interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Excretion (E):**\n",
      "    *   **Clearance Pathway:** Given the high likelihood of extensive metabolism, the primary clearance pathway for the parent drug is expected to be hepatic metabolism. The resulting more polar metabolites would then primarily be excreted renally (via urine).\n",
      "    *   **Biliary Excretion:** If the parent compound is sufficiently lipophilic and its metabolites are large enough or conjugated (e.g., glucuronidation), biliary excretion (via feces) could also play a role, especially for the unmetabolized drug or certain metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary Impact of Low Bioavailability:**\n",
      "The most significant PK property for this drug, as highlighted by the prediction, is its very low oral bioavailability. This implies that if this compound were to be developed as an oral drug, very high doses would be required, or alternative formulations/routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, transdermal, or sublingual) would need to be considered to achieve therapeutic concentrations. Further experimental studies would be crucial to elucidate the exact reasons for this low bioavailability (solubility, efflux, and/or first-pass metabolism) to guide drug development strategies.\n",

      "In summary, the plan involves moving from structure identification to *in silico* prediction, and then rigorously searching experimental databases and literature to obtain confirmed PK data, leveraging the tritium label information if it pertains to specific ADME studies.\n",
      "To answer the question about the PK properties of the drug [3H]c1ccc2nonc2c1[N+](=O)[O-], I need to systematically approach its characterization. The presence of `[3H]` indicates a tritium label, which is often used in ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) studies to track the compound, but the fundamental pharmacokinetic properties relate to the parent molecule itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the step-by-step plan for how I would use tools to answer this question:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Structure Identification and Physicochemical Properties:**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Convert the SMILES string `[3H]c1ccc2nonc2c1[N+](=O)[O-]` into a clear chemical structure and identify its formal name (e.g., IUPAC name, common name if available), molecular formula, and molecular weight.\n",
      "    *   **Tool Plan:** Use a chemical identifier resolver (e.g., PubChem Compound, ChemSpider) to interpret the SMILES, visualize the structure, and obtain basic chemical identifiers. I would also explicitly note the presence of the tritium label.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **In Silico ADME/PK Prediction:**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Predict key pharmacokinetic parameters based on the compound's structure. These predictions provide initial insights into its likely behavior in the body.\n",
      "    *   **Tool Plan:** Utilize online ADME/PK prediction tools (e.g., SwissADME, admetSAR, pkCSM). These tools can estimate properties such as:\n",
      "        *   **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability, Caco-2 permeability, gastrointestinal absorption.\n",
      "        *   **Distribution:** Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, volume of distribution (Vd), plasma protein binding (PPB).\n",
      "        *   **Metabolism:** Prediction of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inhibition or induction, and potential sites of metabolism.\n",
      "        *   **Excretion:** Renal clearance, substrate/inhibitor of efflux transporters (e.g., P-gp).\n",
      "        *   **Physicochemical properties:** LogP (lipophilicity), topological polar surface area (TPSA), solubility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Experimental Data Search:**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Search for any existing experimental pharmacokinetic data, *in vitro* ADMET studies, or *in vivo* animal/human PK data for this exact compound or closely related analogs. This is crucial as experimental data are more definitive than *in silico* predictions. The `[3H]` label suggests it might have been part of an ADME study.\n",
      "    *   **Tool Plan:** Systematically search pharmacological and scientific databases (e.g., PubChem BioAssay, ChEMBL, DrugBank, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, Patents databases). I would use the chemical name, SMILES, and structure to query these databases for relevant studies or clinical information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Metabolism Pathway Prediction:**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** If metabolism is not clearly defined by existing experimental data, predict likely metabolic transformations and potential major metabolites. This is important for understanding drug half-life and potential drug-drug interactions.\n",
      "    *   **Tool Plan:** Use specialized metabolism prediction software (e.g., MetabolitePredictor, BioTransformer, Cytochrome P450 substrate prediction tools) to map out possible metabolic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Data Synthesis and Interpretation:**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Compile all gathered information (predicted and experimental) to provide a comprehensive description of the drug's PK properties, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profile. Discuss any discrepancies between predicted and experimental data.\n",
      "    *   **Tool Plan:** No specific tool, but analytical thinking to synthesize the information from the previous steps into a coherent and thorough answer, addressing all aspects of PK.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and utilizing the specified tools, I can accurately and thoroughly answer the question about the PK properties of the given drug.\n",
